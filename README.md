# Project Zomboid - Immersive CD Players

This project is an unofficial fork of a [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2268557398) mod created by [Nebula](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nebula-rus).  
The author has given me permission to host the mod on Github and help develop the mod.

## Summary

The mod introduces a playable variation of vanilla CD Players that run on batteries and play music. This makes the game more immersive, fun and provides the player with an additional way of reducing boredom and stress.

## Features

### Playable CD's

- Playable CD items are obtained by examining vanilla CD items through the context menu.
- Note that some CD's found in the world may be *scratched* and thus unreadable by the CD player.  
  You can recognize unreadable discs as those that have meta info displayed as "*Unknown*".

### Battery Powered

- Like flashlights and other electronic items, CD Players relay on batteries to run.
- One full battery should provide the player 8 hours (in-game time) of playing time.
- You can insert and remove batteries through the context menu.

### Portable Fun

- CD Player, CD and battery items now have more realistic weight.
- Listening to CD Player music reduces boredom and stress.

### Switching Tracks

- Players can switch the currently playing track using the context menu.
- When the last track on the disc ends, the first track will automatically start playing.

### Smart Play

- The CD player will remember the point at which the player stopped playback.
- Next time the CD Player is turned on it will continue to play from that point.
- The point will be reset if you remove the disc or battery, or the player runs out of power.
